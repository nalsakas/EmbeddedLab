# EmbeddedLab

This repository contains works that I have done while attending TU Chemnitz Embedded Lab.
Each lab folder gradually adds a new feature of the RASPNet.
RASPNet is invented by TU Chemnitz operating systems group for educational purposes.
It is essentially a serial protocol consists of 4 layers.
Protocol format has source, destination, payload and crc fields.
Different communicating nodes are wired through GPIO pins.
Each lab adds a new feature to the final applciation.
For demonstration 4 nodes are connected in circular topology and tested throughly.
