# Embedded-Lab

This repository contains works that I have done while attending TU Chemnitz Embedded Lab.  
Each lab folder gradually adds a new feature of the RASPNet.  
Each lab adds a new feature to the final application.  

RASPNet is invented by TU Chemnitz operating systems group for educational purposes.  
It is essentially a serial communication protocol consists of 4 layers.  
Protocol frame format contain source, destination, payload and crc fields.  
Different communicating nodes are wired through GPIO pins.  Natural implementation uses circular topology.  
For demonstration 4 nodes are connected in circular topology and tested throughly.
